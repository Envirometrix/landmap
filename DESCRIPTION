Title: Automated Spatial Interpolation and/or Prediction using Ensemble Machine Learning
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Tomislav", "Hengl", email = "tom.hengl@opengeohub.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Functions and tools for spatial interpolation and/or prediction of environmental variables (points to grids) 
   based on using Ensemble Machine Learning with geographical distances. Package also provides access to Global 
   Environmental Layers produced by the OpenGeoHub.org foundation and collaborators. Some functions have been migrated and adopted from the GSIF
   (Global Soil Information Facilities) package.
