Title: Automated Spatial Prediction using Ensemble Machine Learning
Version: 0.0.8
Authors@R: person("Tomislav", "Hengl", email = "tom.hengl@opengeohub.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Functions and tools for spatial interpolation and/or prediction of environmental variables (points to grids) 
   based on using Ensemble Machine Learning with geographical distances. Package also provides access to Global 
   Environmental Layers (<https://www.OpenLandMap.org>) produced by the OpenGeoHub.org foundation and collaborators. Some functions have been migrated and adopted from the
   Global Soil Information Facilities package.
