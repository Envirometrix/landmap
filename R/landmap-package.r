#' landmap: Automated Spatial Prediction using Ensemble Machine Learning
#'
#' Geographical distances can be used with remote sensing covariates and process-based derivatives
#' to improve spatial prediction and/or interpolation from point data. This package shows how to
#' fully automate process so that predictions and model errors can be generated using unbiased
#' estimation (train.spLearner package). Additional functions are used to access global layers
#' (from www.openlandmap.org), to process large rasters (spatial tiling) including running own
#' customized functions in parallel.
